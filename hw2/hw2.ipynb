    "Consider [molecules](https://github.com/oleg-kachan/GMML2019/tree/master/hw2/data/molecules) dataset. Each molecule is represented by a point cloud - an arbitrary number of points in 3-dimensional space, corresponding to chemical elements constituting the molecule. Each point also have a label, which we omit for this task.\n",

    "Obtain topological summary  of each molecule's point cloud in the form of a persistent diagram $H_1$, counting 2-dimensional topological holes in the data. Perform the embedding of each point cloud as a single point in 2-dimensional space, using MDS and sliced wasserstein distance between persistent diagrams of point clouds as a metric. Conclude if there are any structure and meaningful clusters in the resulting data embedding.\n",

    "Consider chemical [isomers](https://github.com/oleg-kachan/GMML2019/tree/master/hw2/data/isomers) dataset, containing three different isomers of the same molecule, with the same `label-x-y-z` structure as in the previous dataset. Roughly speaking, isomer is a molecule having the same chemical formula, but different geometric configuration. TDA approach can easiliy separate all three different isomers, so let us study a more complicated problem involving the presence of noise in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Obtain 50-100 noisy samples of each isomer, by adding i.i.d. gaussian noise to each point in its' point cloud. Compute persistent diagram $H_1$ of each noisy sample. Estimate the value of standard deviation $\\sigma$ of gaussian noise, under which classifier of your choice is able to perform with 90% accuracy. For vectorization of persistent diagrams use either MDS embedding w/ sliced wasserstein distance as a metric to $n$-dimensional space with your choice of $n$ or persistent images approach.\n",
